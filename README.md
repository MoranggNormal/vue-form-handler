# What is this

#### This is a test provived by Auryn...

If you somehow wants to run the code, then:

Clone the repo;
<br>
Open your terminal and go to the repo folder;
<br>
Run: <code> npm install</code> or <code> yarn </code>

#### Warning:

It won't work properly whitout an api. Here i made the api using Symfony on Back-end.
<br>
See the endpoint on: <code>/services/baseUrl.js</code>
The backend project who provide the api is <a href="https://github.com/MoranggNormal/symfony_app">here</a>
